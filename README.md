# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
This analysis was to create a webpage that presents a UFO sightings data table that can then be filter by user input by date, city, state, and country. 

## Results: 
A user when visiting the page can filter the available data table by typing a search term and the data table will filter once the user moves away from the input box either by clicking or tabbing to the next box. If the user inputs a term that is not within the available table, then the filtered table will be empty and show no results. 

The following image shows the data table with one filter.

The following image shows the data table with two filters.

## Summary: 
One drawback of this design is that is requires the input to be of a specific format to match directly with the table rows. This means that it could limit how well a user can navigate the table. A future improvement would be to be able to input capitalized names and varying date formats.
